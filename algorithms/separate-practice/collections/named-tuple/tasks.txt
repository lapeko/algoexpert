âœ… 1. Easy â€” Sum of 2D points
    ðŸ“‹ Define a Point namedtuple with x and y fields.
    Given a list of points, return the total x and y sum as a new point.
    points = [Point(1, 2), Point(3, 4), Point(5, 6)]
    â†’ Point(x=9, y=12)

âœ… 2. Easy â€” Convert list of tuples to namedtuples
    ðŸ“‹ You have a list of tuples like [(name, age), ...].
    Convert them to a list of Person namedtuples with fields name, age.
    data = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25)]
    â†’ [Person(name="Alice", age=30), Person(name="Bob", age=25)]

ðŸŸ¡ 3. Medium â€” Find oldest employee
    ðŸ“‹ Define an Employee namedtuple with name, age, salary.
    Given a list of employees, return the one with the highest age.
    [
        Employee("Alice", 30, 100000),
        Employee("Bob", 40, 95000),
        Employee("Charlie", 35, 120000)
    ]
    â†’ Employee("Bob", 40, 95000)

ðŸŸ¡ 4. Medium â€” Sort products by price then name
    ðŸ“‹ Define a Product namedtuple with name and price.
    Given a list of products, return them sorted by price ascending.
    If prices are equal, sort by name alphabetically.
    [
        Product("Apple", 5),
        Product("Banana", 3),
        Product("Avocado", 5),
        Product("Dates", 2)
    ]
    â†’ [
        Product("Dates", 2),
        Product("Banana", 3),
        Product("Apple", 5),
        Product("Avocado", 5)
    ]
