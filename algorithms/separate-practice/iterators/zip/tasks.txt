âœ… 1. Easy â€” Combine names and ages
    ğŸ“‹ Given two lists, one of names and one of ages, return a list of strings like "Alice is 30".
    ["Alice", "Bob"], [30, 25]
    â†’ ["Alice is 30", "Bob is 25"]

ğŸŸ¡ 2. Medium â€” Transpose a matrix
    ğŸ“‹ Given a 2D list (matrix), return its transpose using zip().
    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6]
    ]
    â†’ [
      [1, 4],
      [2, 5],
      [3, 6]
    ]
