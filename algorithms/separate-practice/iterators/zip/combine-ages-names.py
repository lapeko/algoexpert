# âœ… 1. Easy â€” Combine names and ages
#     ðŸ“‹ Given two lists, one of names and one of ages, return a list of strings like "Alice is 30".

# ðŸŸ¡ 2. Medium â€” Transpose a matrix
#     ðŸ“‹ Given a 2D list (matrix), return its transpose using zip().

#     ]
#     â†’ [

#         [2, 5],
#         [3, 6]
#     ]
